# This project is based on the ML 
I have used sqlite lite as a data base and make such a system for scanning the attendence of the empoloyees by using QR codes 

# For viewing the Database I have used `DB browser of SQLITE`

# Install all the dependences first of all like `pip install module name `That i have mentioned in the `pip intall.txt` file

# In QRCodes directory The separate QR will be generated to the person and by using that QR code we can scan the attendence of the employee by simply taking snap of the qr code in the phone or sending the qr code to the whatsapp
